In order to enhance actual structural finite element simulations, my last mission consisted in the development of a methodology to experimentaly estimate exoskeleton's actuators torsors efforts through extensometry data. Considering the huge amount of data a software was developed to treat the data and optimize strain gauges placement (Python and MySQL)."
